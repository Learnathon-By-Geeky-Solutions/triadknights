Here is a **detailed breakdown** of each phase of your **e-commerce web application for farmers**, ensuring you complete it within one month.

# **Phase 1: User Authentication & Product Display**

### **Objective:** Implement user authentication (JWT) and display products on the homepage.

### **Tasks:**

✅ **Set up Backend (Spring Boot & MySQL)**

- Initialize a Spring Boot project using **Spring Initializr** with dependencies:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Data JPA
  - MySQL Driver
  - Spring Boot DevTools
  - Lombok
  - JWT Library (jjwt)
- Configure **application.properties** to connect with MySQL.

✅ **Implement JWT-Based Authentication**

- Create **User Entity** (with `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`).
- Create **Authentication API**:
  - `POST /auth/register` → Register new users (Farmer, Buyer, Admin).
  - `POST /auth/login` → Authenticate user and generate JWT token.
- Secure endpoints with **Spring Security and JWT**.

✅ **Frontend: User Login & Signup**

- Create **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** pages for:
  - User registration form.
  - User login form.

✅ **Set Up Product Entity & Display Products**

- Create **Product Entity** (with `id`, `name`, `price`, `description`, `image`, `farmer_id`).
- Create **Product API**:
  - `GET /products` → Fetch all products.
- Display products on the **homepage** using a Bootstrap-based grid.

✅ **Testing**

- Test **authentication APIs** using **Postman**.
- Ensure **products are retrieved and displayed** correctly.

# **Phase 2: Role-Based Authorization & Product Management**

### **Objective:** Implement role-based authorization and CRUD operations for products.

### **Tasks:**

✅ **Implement Role-Based Authorization**

- Update **User Entity** to include roles: `FARMER`, `BUYER`, `ADMIN`.
- Restrict access to different endpoints:
  - Farmers can **only manage their own products**.
  - Buyers can **only view and buy products**.
  - Admins can **manage all users and products**.

✅ **Product Management (CRUD)**

- Create **APIs for product management**:
  - `POST /products` → Add a new product (Only for farmers).
  - `PUT /products/{id}` → Update product details (Only for farmers who own the product).
  - `DELETE /products/{id}` → Delete product (Only for farmers who own the product or admin).
- Implement **file upload** for product images.

✅ **Admin Dashboard**

- Create an **Admin Panel** where the admin can:
  - View all users.
  - Delete users if necessary.
  - View all products and remove inappropriate ones.

✅ **Frontend: Product Management**

- Create **Add Product Page** for Farmers.
- Create **Admin Dashboard** for managing users and products.
- Implement **product validation** (e.g., required fields, image format).

✅ **Testing**

- Test **role-based access** using Postman.
- Ensure farmers **can only manage their own products**.

# **Phase 3: Cart System & Order Management**

### **Objective:** Implement add-to-cart, checkout, and order tracking.

### **Tasks:**

✅ **Cart System**

- Create **Cart Entity** (with `cart_id`, `user_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`).
- Implement **Cart API**:
  - `POST /cart` → Add a product to the cart.
  - `GET /cart` → View all cart items.
  - `DELETE /cart/{id}` → Remove a product from the cart.

✅ **Frontend: Cart Page**

- Create **cart page** to show all products added to the cart.
- Implement **"Remove from Cart"** button.

✅ **Order Management**

- Create **Order Entity** (with `order_id`, `buyer_id`, `product_id`, `status`, `payment_status`).
- Implement **Order API**:
  - `POST /orders` → Place an order.
  - `GET /orders` → View order history.
- Farmers can see **who purchased their products**.

✅ **Frontend: Order Page**

- Create **Order History Page** to show purchased items.
- Display order status.

✅ **Testing**

- Add products to the cart and verify.
- Place orders and check database updates.

# **Phase 4: Payment, ACID Compliance & Deployment**

### **Objective:** Implement payment methods, ensure database consistency, and deploy the project.

### **Tasks:**

✅ **Payment Integration (bKash, Rocket)**

- Create **Payment Entity** (with `payment_id`, `order_id`, `amount`, `status`).
- Implement **Payment API**:
  - `POST /payments/bkash` → Simulated payment for bKash.
  - `POST /payments/rocket` → Simulated payment for Rocket.
- Update **Order API** to mark an order as **"Paid"** after successful payment.

✅ **Ensure ACID Compliance**

- Use **transactions in Spring Boot** to ensure:
  - Payment & order update happen together (Atomicity).
  - No duplicate payments (Consistency).
  - Payments remain in the correct order (Isolation).
  - Orders are never lost (Durability).

✅ **Display Hero Products**

- Fetch **most sold products** from database.
- Display them as **featured products on homepage**.

✅ **Testing & Debugging**

- Perform **end-to-end testing** of the app.
- Fix **bugs and edge cases**.

✅ **Deployment**

- Host backend on **Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean**.
- Deploy frontend using **Netlify or GitHub Pages**.

✅ **Fully functional e-commerce website**  
✅ **Secure authentication & authorization**  
✅ **Product management system**  
✅ **Shopping cart & order management**  
✅ **Payment integration**  
✅ **Database with ACID properties**
