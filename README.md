## Project Description

The **Digital Marketplace for Farmers** is an online platform designed to connect farmers directly with buyers, such as retailers, restaurants, and individual consumers. The platform aims to eliminate intermediaries, ensuring fair pricing, secure transactions, and improved market access for farmers. 

### Key Features:
- **Farmer-Centric Tools**: Farmers can easily register, list their products (crops, dairy, poultry), track sales, and manage inventory.
- **Buyer-Friendly Experience**: Buyers can browse products, place orders, and make payments securely through integrated local gateways like bKash and Nagad.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Promotes fairness by eliminating middlemen.
- **Logistics Support**: Facilitates coordination for delivery and order fulfillment.
- **Analytics & Insights**: Provides tools for demand forecasting and market trend analysis.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensures accessibility across devices.

The project leverages modern technologies, including **Spring Boot** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **MySQL** for database management. With these tools, the platform aims to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain, empowering farmers and enhancing access to fresh produce for consumers.
